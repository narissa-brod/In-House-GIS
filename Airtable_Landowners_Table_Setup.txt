VIEWS TO CREATE:
===============

1. "All Owners" - Default grid view
2. "High Value Properties" - Filter by Property Value > $500,000
3. "Out of State Owners" - Filter where State ≠ UT
4. "Contacted" - Filter by Contact Status
5. "Active Deals" - Filter where Deals is not empty

AUTOMATION IDEAS:
================

1. When owner added → Send Slack notification
2. When Contact Status = "Interested" → Create task in project management
3. Duplicate check → Alert if APN already exists
